# Machine-Learning-in-Action
This is a summary of each chapter of the book *Machine Learning in Action* authored by Peter Harrington with Python practice in Jupyter Notebook.     
**Language:** English   
Trying to get it finished...at least :(    
**Notes:** There are some mistakes in the texts and codes due to typo or different versions of Python (from 2.x to 3.7). I've tried my best to correct them.
